# Lectura Fácil Corpus in Spanish
This project is part of the result of a Master's thesis where we seek to create a text corpus, from scratch and in spanish, to resolve the problem of binary clasification between text written in general natural language or "Lectura fácil", a term in spanish that means "Easy read". This project has been made in collaboration with the Polytechnic University of Madrid.

## What is "Lectura Fácil"?
According to the official definition: It is a method that includes a set of guidelines and recommendations related to the writing of texts, the design and layout of documents and the validation of their comprehensibility, aimed at making information accessible to people with reading comprehension difficulties.

In this [website](https://www.plenainclusion.org/discapacidad-intelectual/recurso/lectura-facil/) you can find some useful information and resources about "Easy read" methodology in Spanish.

## Some context?
"Easy read" methodology is a language discipline that belongs to the text simplification field, that was born in Sweden in the 60s and which today you can find a lot of information and text corpora in "Easy read" methodology in English, but in Spanish it is another story. Since the last 10 years approximately a some papers have been published and research has been made regarding Spanish text simplification, but there has not been as much progress in this field as in English, that is why there is still no standardized Spanish "Easy read" corpora.
